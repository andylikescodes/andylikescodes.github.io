## How much Bayes is it in our brain?
I am having this thought that our neural might be encoding using a Baysian framework. There is a paper [(Colombo & SeriÃ¨s, 2012)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?B67pov) talking about Bayesian modelling in Neuroscience. Before writing about what I think about this, the very first thing that I would like to get into is what the ideas are in this paper.**
