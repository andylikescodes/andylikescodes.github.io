## How much Bayes is it in our brain?
I am having this thought that the neural network in our brain might encode information using a Baysian framework. There is a paper [(Colombo & SeriÃ¨s, 2012)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?B67pov) talking about Bayesian modelling in neuroscience. Before writing about what I think about this, it is important to see what is already been studied here.
