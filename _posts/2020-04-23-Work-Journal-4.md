A few things:

Tomorrow there are two important meetings
1. The Freesurfer meeting
2. The kickoff meeting with Frederick and Patrick

It is almost impossible to develop a generic and good pipeline tonight, so I should change my target in developing some visualization that could help with the meeting tomorrow. The goal for tomorrow's meeting will be show how the dataset looks like, and some thoughts about how to move forward. So I guess visualization is not the most important thing in this case, it is ideas and communication.

I have about 3 hours before 12. In this three hours, it is the best to get the Freesurfer assignment done, it is best to finish it within an hour.
