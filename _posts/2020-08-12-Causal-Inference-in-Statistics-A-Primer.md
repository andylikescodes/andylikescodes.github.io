This post is a review of the book: Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer (Pearl, 2016)

Under Pearl's framework, causal inference can be carried out using the do calculas. For example, if we want to measure the average causal effect (ACE), we usually want to estimate 

$$P(Y=1||do(X=1))-P(Y=1||do(X=0))$$

Therefore, we would like to estimate the distribution $$P(Y=1||do(X=x))$$
