Satuarday should probably take a break, however, I still have done something. I guess I need to always in a mode that I am extreamly relax. When I feel myself intense, I should just let go. Relaxing myself is the best way to improve efficiency. 

Get use to relaxing. When working, relax. When making decisions, relax. Facing any situations, relax. The worse cases scenario is just like right now, nobody cares about you. 

It is also good that I don't care about any others. I guess this is the way I choose to live. I am a lonely man, but that's OK. May be that's good. No need to pretend to be happy, no need to pretend to be social. I am not, I don't care, so I don't have to pretend that I care.
