Went to bed at 3am yesterday. Don't think it is a good idea to continue. Need to go to bed before 12 today, may be 1am. I guess for me resting at 1am might be a good idea, after long years of not going to bed early.

Got up around 10:30am in the morning. I guess I will have to get up a little bit earier and start my day
