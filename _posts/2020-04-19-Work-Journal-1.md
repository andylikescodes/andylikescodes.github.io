Went to bed at 3am yesterday. Don't think it is a good idea to continue. Need to go to bed before 12 today, may be 1am. I guess for me resting at 1am might be a good idea, after long years of not going to bed early.

Got up around 10:30am in the morning. I guess I will have to get up a little bit earier and start my day. This is quite important because I will need to invest a lot of time in working and doing all different kinds of works.

In general, the things that I planned to do has done quite well. Had a great meeting with the Clever Hans team and seems like everyone is up to speed to their part. In the afternoon, spent some time looked into an important paper about source localization.

At night before bed need to try to finish reading the Baysian blog post; I guess I can break this down into 3 days. This is not an extream important paper, but it is something I am very interested in and will give me some insides of my potential research topics.
