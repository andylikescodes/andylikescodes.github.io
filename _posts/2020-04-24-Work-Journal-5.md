Today is efficient. Have done a lot of stuff, got a good kickoff meeting for the COVID project. Also able to get things going with the pipeline. Keep writing this blog post and keep studying the source modeling techniques. 

Moving forward everyday. It is so important that I make progress day by day. Always ask this question: am I better that I was yesterday. Have I learned something new? Am I one tiny step closer to my goal? Am I doing the things that I really want to do? Am I trying my very best?

I guess my answers to all the questions in the above are yeses. I think I probably won't work harder than this, even though I still think that there are times when I could be more efficient. There are times when I could be more deciplined. But I guess, this is the best version of me so far. It could be better in the future, but as some I said before: I can do this slower, better. Always stay calm, stay cool
