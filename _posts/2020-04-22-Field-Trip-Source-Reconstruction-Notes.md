Today had lots of meetings. Not very efficient. This week has lots of tasks to do.. Going to be a very busy week.

Still, waking up around 10 is too late. Need to really go to bed as early as possible and wake up as early as possible. But sometimes I also think that it might just be better to let it go. My lifestyle over the past 30 years have always been so stressed, that I need to catch up and catch up and catch up.. May be now is the time that I am going to stay calm for anything.. Stay calm for stress, stay calm for presentation, stay calm for departure, stay calm for coming home, stay calm for new acquaintances, stay calm for separation.. 

Not so much exciting for praise, success, and not so sad for failure, stagnation. 不以物喜，不以己悲，宠辱不惊。

Finish things one by one, solve problems step by step. No rush, and no anxiety. Stay calm and happy, smile always, and love your work.
