Different tapers have different leakage profile. The simplest taper is a box taper, which cut offs everything for some specific values and only leave the values within a certain range. The leakage profile for the box taper is pretty bad - many frequencies near the target frequency are contributing to the power. A Hanning taper or Gaussian taper is attenuating the the contribution of the frequencies further away from the target frequency while having a larger
