Study Notes for Cousera Course: [Causal Inference I]([https://www.coursera.org/learn/causal-inference](https://www.coursera.org/learn/causal-inference)) by Mchael Sobel.

If we have an observed treatment $Z$ and a test statistic $t(Z, y)$. If we calculate $t(Z, y)$ for all other treatment assignments, we get a distribution of $t(Z, y)$. When we calculate $t = t(Z, y)$ using the observed $Z$ and $y$, we are assuming the Null Hypothesis, $H_0$, that there is no treatment effect. We have the distribution for $t(Z, y)$, and we know under $H_0$ the statistic we have is t. And we calculate the probability that $t(Z, y)$ is greater than t. In the example, the statistics $t(Z, y)$ used $\bar{Y}_t - \bar{Y}_c$
