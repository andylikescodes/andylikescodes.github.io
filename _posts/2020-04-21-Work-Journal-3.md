Today had lots of meetings. Not very efficient. This week has lots of tasks to do.. Going to be a very busy week.

Still, waking up around 10 is too late. Need to really go to bed as early as possible and wake up as early as possible. But sometimes I also think that it might just be better to let it go. My lifestyle over the past 30 years have always been so stressed, that I need to catch up and catch up and catch up.. May be now
