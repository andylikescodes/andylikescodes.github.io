This post a review of the paper: Introduction to the Foundations of Causal Discovery. [(Eberhardt, 2017)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?fcxQxy)

Causal relationships are important because it shows us how a system behaves under intervention. A causal relationship is usually studied under an experimental setting such as a randomized controlled trial “each individual in the experiment is randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group”. A randomized controlled trial gets rid of the effects of confound variables that are the common causes of the targeted variables. A do operator is introduced p(y|do(x)) is introduced to distinguish the interventional conditional probability from the observational conditional probability p(y|x).
