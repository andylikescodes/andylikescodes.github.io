This is Andy! Thank you for visiting. I am now a graduate student in California majoring in computational and data science. I am interested in autonomous vehicle, deep learning and computer vision. I believe the near future belongs to AI and data. I am working very hard on these topics right now and hopefully one day I will be able to contribute to the field.

The main purpose of this blog is to keep track of what I have studied, read and done so I can easily refer back. Lately I have been buried with so many website links and pdf papers so I think keeping a blog would be necessary to keep track of everything.
